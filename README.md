# ALX Higher Level Programming

Welcome to my repository for the **ALX Software Engineering Program**. These projects are part of the higher-level programming curriculum and showcase my work as I progress through Python, C, shell scripting, and JavaScript exercises.

### About the Program
In this **ALX Sprint 2**, I focus on mastering high-level programming with an emphasis on Python. This involves:
- Building foundational concepts (e.g., loops, functions, data structures)
- Exploring Object-Oriented Programming
- Implementing Test-Driven Development
- Diving into advanced topics like SQL, OOP, and network programming
